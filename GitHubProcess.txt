We found GitHub to be extremely helpful in our project work.
Brett had worked previously in GitHub for SQL in past internships, so that
background made the transition easier. As our project was inspired by other work
we found online, we were able to put that source code into GitHub to use as a
reference should we reach a roadblock in our Make process. This reference allowed
us to challenge ourselves while ensuring that we weren’t banging our heads
against the wall to fix a small issue in the code. Our goal in doing this was to
ensure that we continuously challenge ourselves while remaining focused on the
finished project.  One example of this was the splitting of the asteroids when
contact was made between the asteroid and the laser. This reference code is not
in our final project folder as to not cause confusion between files.

Moving forward, one thing we would like to improve is the capability to have our
ship “bounce” off asteroids when contact is made, instead of passing through the
asteroid. Further, another aspect we would like to improve on is the scoring
system in the game. Ideally, we would want the player to have 5 lives, losing
one each time the ship hit any asteroids. This would create more risk and
frustration for the player, ideally incentivizing them to play again.
